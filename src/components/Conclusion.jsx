            <p>I am very happy with the results of my projects and learned a lot about how deep learning can be applied to robotics problems. I am eager to atually implement this on the robot, which was the intention, but I had some time constraints near the end of this semester
                For further improvements on the models - I really do think better and wider range of data will help this model learn better, as well as some hardware tweaking to ensure the robot doesn't blur everything when going around a turn. I have learned a tremendous amount from trouble shooting hardware, 
                figuring out why colab is closing, a ton of information about the deep learning model building steps, and how to project manage/know which issue to come at. The models can only get better since they beat the baseline and I look forward to tinkering on this project more. I had an amazing semester and am thankful for the opportunity to present this project
                for Dr. Badri Adhikari's Deep Learning CS 5390 course.
